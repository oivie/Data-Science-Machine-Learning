# Introduction: The Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset provides valuable information on sleep patterns, lifestyle habits,
# and cardiovascular health across 400 individuals. This dataset includes a wide range of variables such as sleep duration,
# quality, physical activity, stress levels, BMI, and the presence of sleep disorders. While the data provides insights
# into how lifestyle factors influence sleep, challenges such as the subjective nature of some metrics
# (e.g., stress levels, sleep quality), and missing data could impact the accuracy of any conclusions drawn from the dataset.
# The goal of this project is to explore these challenges and use the dataset to uncover meaningful correlations between lifestyle factors and sleep health, as well as predict potential sleep disorders.
# Reference: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset
# Here are five key questions we aim to answer using the Sleep Health and Lifestyle dataset:
#   1.	How do physical activity levels correlate with the quality of sleep?
#   2.   Does stress level impact sleep duration?
#   3.   Can we predict someone's BMI category based on their sleep duration and physical activity level?
#   4.   How does age impact sleep duration and quality?
#   5.   What is the relationship between BMI category and stress levels?

# The new data has a column 'Class', which contains the oversampled target

```



```{r}
# Train a decision tree model on the balanced data

```

```{r}

```{r}
# Check if the model can correctly predict 'Overweight' category
overweight_preds <- test_predictions == "Overweight"
actual_overweight <- testData$BMICategory == "Overweight"

# Print accuracy for the "Overweight" class
overweight_accuracy <- sum(overweight_preds == actual_overweight) / length(actual_overweight)

The model results displayed in the image are from a decision tree model (rpart) applied to predict the BMI category using two predictors: SleepDuration and PhysicalActivity. Here's a breakdown of the results:
1. Model Type: CART (Classification and Regression Tree)
This model was used to classify the BMI category into four classes: 'Normal', 'Normal Weight', 'Obese', and 'Overweight.'

2. Number of Samples:
The model was trained using 263 samples, which is the number of records available after data partitioning into the training set.

3. Number of Predictors:
The two predictors used are SleepDuration and PhysicalActivity.

4. Resampling Method:
The model used Bootstrapping (25 repetitions) to validate its performance. Bootstrapping is a statistical method that involves repeatedly sampling from the data to assess the model's variability.

5. Tuning Parameter (cp - Complexity Parameter):
The cp parameter is used to control the size of the decision tree. The model was evaluated across three values of cp:

cp = 0.09920635: Accuracy = 83.36%, Kappa = 0.6749684
cp = 0.15079365: Accuracy = 75.43%, Kappa = 0.5249850
cp = 0.43650794: Accuracy = 60.49%, Kappa = 0.1924227
Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions made by the model. Kappa measures how well the model performed compared to random chance, with higher values indicating better performance.

6. Optimal Model:
The best-performing model was selected based on the highest accuracy. The optimal value of cp was 0.09920635, which achieved:

7. Accuracy: 83.36% (indicating the model correctly predicted BMI categories for 83.36% of the test samples).
Kappa: 0.6749684 (indicating a good level of agreement between the predictions and the actual classes, with values above 0.6 generally considered substantial).

Summary:
The decision tree model performed reasonably well in predicting BMI categories based on sleep duration and physical activity. The best model had an accuracy of 83.36% and a substantial Kappa score of 0.6749684. The model was optimized using a complexity parameter (cp) of 0.09920635.

# QUESTIONS:

# 1. How do physical activity levels correlate with the quality of sleep?
# To examine the correlation between physical activity levels and quality of sleep, we can use the cor() function
# or create a scatter plot. Here's how youwe can modify the code to answer this question:
```{r}
# Add a Correlation and Scatter Plot:
# Calculate correlation
correlation_physical_activity_sleep <- cor(dataset$PhysicalActivity, dataset$QualityOfSleep)
print(paste("Correlation between Physical Activity and Quality of Sleep:", correlation_physical_activity_sleep))
```
The correlation value between Physical Activity and Quality of Sleep is 0.1929, which indicates a very weak positive correlation. This means that while there is a slight tendency for individuals with higher physical activity levels to have better sleep quality, the relationship is not strong. Essentially, physical activity has a minor effect on sleep quality based on this dataset.


```{r}
# Scatter plot
ggplot(dataset, aes(x = PhysicalActivity, y = QualityOfSleep)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Physical Activity vs. Quality of Sleep", x = "Physical Activity", y = "Quality of Sleep")
```

# -------------------------------------------------------
# 2. Does stress level impact sleep duration?
# Similarly, we can calculate the correlation between stress levels and sleep duration or visualize this relationship with a scatter plot:
```{r}
# Calculate correlation
correlation_stress_sleep <- cor(dataset$StressLevel, dataset$SleepDuration)
print(paste("Correlation between Stress Level and Sleep Duration:", correlation_stress_sleep))
```
The correlation between Stress Level and Sleep Duration is -0.8110, which indicates a strong negative correlation. This means that as stress levels increase, sleep duration tends to decrease significantly. In other words, higher stress is strongly associated with shorter sleep duration in this dataset.


```{r}
# Scatter plot
ggplot(dataset, aes(x = StressLevel, y = SleepDuration)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "red") +
  labs(title = "Stress Level vs. Sleep Duration", x = "Stress Level", y = "Sleep Duration")
```



# -------------------------------------------------------
# 3. Can we predict someone's BMI category based on their sleep duration and physical activity level?
# For this, we already have a machine learning model built using caret. We can modify it slightly
# to use the BMI category as the target variable and SleepDuration and PhysicalActivity as features.
```{r}
# Since we've already trained models for both binary and multiclass classification, you we can use the results from model_bmi_binary and model_bmi.
```

# -------------------------------------------------------
# 4. How does age impact sleep duration and quality?
# We can calculate correlations between age and both sleep duration and quality,
# and also visualize these relationships with scatter plots:
```{r}
# Correlation between Age and Sleep Duration
correlation_age_sleep <- cor(dataset$Age, dataset$SleepDuration)
print(paste("Correlation between Age and Sleep Duration:", correlation_age_sleep))
```
The correlation between Age and Sleep Duration is 0.3447, indicating a moderate positive correlation. This suggests that as age increases, sleep duration tends to increase moderately as well, but the relationship is not very strong. Therefore, older individuals may sleep slightly longer on average, but the effect is not substantial.


```{r}
# Correlation between Age and Quality of Sleep
correlation_age_quality <- cor(dataset$Age, dataset$QualityOfSleep)
print(paste("Correlation between Age and Quality of Sleep:", correlation_age_quality))
```
The correlation between Age and Quality of Sleep is 0.4737, indicating a moderate positive correlation. This suggests that as age increases, the quality of sleep tends to improve moderately. However, while there is a relationship between the two variables, the strength of the relationship is not extremely high, meaning other factors could also be influencing sleep quality.



```{r}
# Scatter plots
ggplot(dataset, aes(x = Age, y = SleepDuration)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "green") +
  labs(title = "Age vs Sleep Duration", x = "Age", y = "Sleep Duration")

ggplot(dataset, aes(x = Age, y = QualityOfSleep)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", col = "purple") +
  labs(title = "Age vs Quality of Sleep", x = "Age", y = "Quality of Sleep")
```
# -------------------------------------------------------
# 5. What is the relationship between BMI category and stress levels?
# Create a box plot to show how stress levels vary across different BMI categories:


```{r}
# Box plot
ggplot(dataset, aes(x = BMICategory, y = StressLevel)) +
  geom_boxplot(fill = "orange") +
  labs(title = "BMI Category vs. Stress Level", x = "BMI Category", y = "Stress Level")
```



# -------------------------------------------------------

# Summary of Q's:
# Physical Activity and Quality of Sleep: Use the cor() function and scatter plot to visualize the correlation.
# This can be added in the code using the snippet for Question 1.

# Stress Level and Sleep Duration: Similarly, use the cor() function and a scatter plot for visualization (Question 2).
# Predict BMI Category: The machine learning model can predict BMI based on Sleep Duration and Physical Activity (Question 3).
# Age Impact on Sleep: Use correlations and scatter plots to analyze the relationship (Question 4).
# BMI and Stress Levels: A box plot helps you visualize how stress levels differ across BMI categories (Question 5).
